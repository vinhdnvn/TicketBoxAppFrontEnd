    synopsis:
      "Thirteen years after the Na'vi repelled the Resources Development Administration's (RDA) attempt to infiltrate Pandora with humans, Jake Sully continues to lead the Omaticaya clan as clan chief and raises a family with Neytiri that consists of sons Neteyam and Lo'ak, a daughter named Tuk, and an adopted daughter named Kiri (who was created from Grace Augustine's inert avatar). Colonel Miles Quaritch's son Spider, who was born on Pandora and couldn't be brought to Earth in cryostasis because he was so young, is inseparable from his children. The RDA returns to Earth while Earth is dying to prepare Pandora for human settlement, much to the chagrin of the Na'vi. Recombinants, Na'vi avatars implanted with the minds and memories of deceased human warriors, are among the newcomers, with Quaritch's recombinant acting as their guide.",
